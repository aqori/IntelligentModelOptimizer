# IntelligentModelOptimizer

## Description

A hierarchical attention-based neural network framework for multimodal learning, integrating computer vision and natural language processing capabilities via knowledge graph embeddings and graph convolutional networks.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the IntelligentModelOptimizer software project:
- "Automates hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes",
- "Leverages transfer learning to accelerate model training on new datasets",
- "Supports ensemble methods for combining multiple models and improving predictions",
- "Provides explainability techniques, such as SHAP values and partial dependence plots, for model interpretability",
- "Optimizes model architecture search using evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning",
- "Includes automated feature engineering tools for data preprocessing and transformation",
- "Integrates with popular deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, for seamless model deployment"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
